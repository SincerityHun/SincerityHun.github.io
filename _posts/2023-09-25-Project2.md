## 1. Project Overview

> Project Background

- Hackathon in [SKKU](https://www.skku.edu/eng/)
- In today's world, where mobility has dramatically improved compared to the past, it's common for people to live in cities or countries different from their hometown. In such cases, many feel comfortable only visiting the hospitals they used to go to, but often find themselves unable to do so. Consequently, people frequently end up visiting new hospitals with a sense of unease or delaying their appointments, thus postponing their visits. To alleviate these difficulties, we have created a service that allows the sharing of historical medical diagnoses.
