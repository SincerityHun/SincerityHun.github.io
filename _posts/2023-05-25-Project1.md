## 5. Service Flow & Core Features with Architecture

- <b>System Configuration and User Roles.</b>
   1. Normal 
   2. Researcher
   3. Manager

- "Normal" User (part-time employees, outsourcing companies)
   * Generation of data through cross-sectional analysis of freshly slaughtered meat and entry of meat information.
   * Ability to modify own data within three days.
   * Access to review only self-created data.

- "Researcher" User (lab researchers, head office employees)
   * Capability to generate new data from both fresh and processed meat.
   * Authorization to approve data created by "Normal" users if no abnormalities are detected.
   * "Permission" to modify approved data and add supplementary information.
   * Access to view all system data.

- "Manager" User (administrator)
   * Elevated privileges as a Super User.
   * Responsibilities include user permission modification and information management.

- <b>Service flow</b>
   ![Service Flow Image](/assets/img/2023-05-25/serviceflow.png)
   * Upon entry of basic fresh meat information by a "Normal" user, the "Researcher" user can perform the following functions:
      1. Input of additional experimental data derived from processing the relevant fresh meat, including:
         - Utilization of QR code or barcode recognition.
         - Implementation of Excel import/export capabilities.
         - Execution of specific data rejection and approval processes.
         - Application of data restoration using the Recycle Bin.

      2. Compilation and analysis of overall statistical data, including:
         - Regional trends in fresh meat slaughter.
         - Variations in quality grades based on processing status.
         - Alterations in taste profiles relative to processing frequencies.
         - Other related metrics.
         
      3. Prediction of meat grade and taste profiles using cross-sectional data analysis.

   <img src="/assets/img/2023-05-25/architecture.png" alt="Architecture Image">
   </div>
   
   * Flutter App, React Web
      - Interfaces utilized by Normal and Researcher users, respectively.
      - Collection of basic data and imagery of fresh meat via Flutter App.
      - Entry and management of additional processed meat data, alongside statistical analysis and prediction capabilities, through React Web.
   
   * Firebase Storage
      - Acts as an intermediary storage for images of fresh and processed meat.
      - Provides a buffer to manage simultaneous modifications of identical images from the app and web before final database entry (S3 storage).

   * RDS Postgresql DB, S3 Storage
      - RDS PostgreSQL DB stores basic meat data, sensory test results, and laboratory data.
      - S3 Storage houses cross-sectional imagery of fresh, heated, and processed meats.

   * Elastic Load Balancer
      - Distributes network load across three EC2 instances.
 
   * AWS EC2 Instance
      1. NGINX
         - Functions as a Reverse Proxy Server for Load Balancing and Enhanced Security.

      2. Gunicorn
         - Serves as a Web Server Gateway Interface for efficient traffic management.
         
      3. Flask Server(Single Process)
         - Modularization
            - Emphasizes modular design, separating DB Schema and DB Controller.
         - API Segregation
            - Implements API Segregation through a structured Request and Response Model.

## 7. Trouble Shooting
1. [Database Architecture Design](/posts/Project1_1/):
   - What are the best practices for implementing a robust and efficient database architecture?

2. [API Specification Development](/posts/Project1_2/):
   - How can we develop an API specification that is both scalable and maintainable, ensuring long-term service reliability?

3. [Concurrent Database Access Management](/posts/Project1_3/):
   - What strategies can be employed to effectively manage issues arising from simultaneous database access by multiple users?

4. [Traffic Scalability Solutions](/posts/Project1_4):
   - What architectural improvements are necessary to accommodate and efficiently handle increasing levels of traffic?

5. [Continuous Deployment Processes](/posts/Project1_5):
   - How can we implement a seamless, non-stop deployment cycle utilizing Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows, specifically through the integration of Docker and GitHub?
